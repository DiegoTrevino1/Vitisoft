LoginManager

LoginManager class has methods to manage logging in, out, account creation or deletion.

To use, be sure to initialize a LoginManager object, which must be passed a database manager object as a parameter for its constructor to allow for database integration.

Once initialized, the LoginManager’s methods can be used.

LoginManager (DatabaseManager db)
Initialize a login manager by passing it a database manager as parameter.

logIn (String username, String password)
The password being in plain text (unencrypted). This uses this info to check against the hashed password and username stored in the database and if successful, logs the user in.

logOut ()
Logs out current account.

addAccount (Account account)
Provide an account object as a parameter to add it to the database. Accounts themselves are created using the Account class constructor. To see the full process of creating an account
and adding it to the database, see the Account class.

removeAccount (String username)
Removes account by using username as the key for querying the database.

getCurrentAccount ()
Returns the currently logged in account’s username.

Also includes a checkPassword helper method to allow login.

Account

Account classes are objects that store usernames, passwords (in the form of SHA256 hashes), last login time, email, first name, and last name of user.

Account (String username, String password, String email, String firstName, String lastName)
To initialize, pass the above parameters as input by the user (with the password being plain text). The constructor will store the data, then hash the password and store it as well. 
To create an account, get user input, then initialize it, then pass it to the LoginManager’s add account method.

There are more methods, to include getters for every field, but they are not necessary for most uses. The main function of the Account class is the constructor.
